# Handwritten Digit Recognition with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository presents a handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the learning model. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. The CNN model architecture, training process, and results are described below.

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image.


# CNN Model Architecture
The CNN model used for this handwritten digit recognition system has the following architecture:

```python
cnn = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
The model consists of several key layers:

Conv2D : layers with filters of size 32 and 64, and kernel size of (3, 3), to capture important image features.

MaxPooling2D : layers with pool size of (2, 2), which downsamples the feature maps and retains the most relevant information.

Flatten layer : to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.

Dense layers : with 64 units and ReLU activation function, which act as a traditional neural network for classification.

The final Dense layer : with 10 units and softmax activation function, which produces probabilities for each digit class.

# Training and Evaluation
The CNN model is compiled using the following settings:

```python
cnn.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

The Adam optimizer is used with the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, suitable for multi-class classification problems. The accuracy metric is also computed during training.

The model is then trained on the MNIST training set using the fit function:

```python
cnn.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```
This trains the model for 10 epochs, optimizing the weights to minimize the loss.

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) vs Fully Connected Neural Network
CNN and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) are both deep learning architectures used for various machine learning tasks. However, they have fundamental differences in their design and application.

## Spatial Structure
CNNs take advantage of the spatial structure of images. They use convolutional layers that slide filters over the input image, capturing local patterns and spatial dependencies. FCNNs, on the other hand, treat input data as a flat vector, ignoring any spatial relationships.

## Parameter Sharing
In CNNs, the same set of weights is shared across different spatial locations of the input. This reduces the number of parameters and enables the network to learn local patterns that are translation-invariant. In FCNNs, each neuron in a layer is connected to all neurons in the previous layer, resulting in a high number of parameters.

## Feature Hierarchy
CNNs are designed to automatically learn and extract hierarchical features from images. The initial layers of a CNN learn basic low-level features, such as edges and corners. Deeper layers learn more complex features, combining the low-level features to detect higher-level patterns. FCNNs, however, do not have this inherent feature hierarchy and require explicit feature engineering.

# Conclusion
The CNN model architecture and training process presented in this repository offer an effective solution for handwritten digit recognition. By leveraging the power of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, the model can accurately classify handwritten digits. You can further explore and optimize the model by adjusting hyperparameters, trying different architectures, or incorporating regularization techniques.
